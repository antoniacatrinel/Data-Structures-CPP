# Data Structures C++

Implement in C++ the given container (ADT) using a given representation and data structure.

## ADT Bag represented on Singly Linked List

***ADT Bag*** - implemented using **a singly linked list with dynamic allocation** with **(element, frequency)** pairs.

## ADT Matrix represented on Binary Search Tree

***ADT Matrix*** - represented as a sparse matrix where **<line, column, value> triplets** (value != 0) are memorized. The elements are stored in a binary search tree with linked representation with dynamic allocation.

## ADT Set represented on Hashtable

***ADT Set*** - implemented using a hashtable with open adressing and double hashing as collision resolution. The hashtable is dynamic: set a threshold for α and resize and rehash the table when the actual load factor is higher than α.\
**Note:** The capacity of the set is always a prime number in order to reduce the number of collisions!

## ADT SortedBag represented on Dynamic Array

***ADT Sorted Bag*** - having elements of type **TComp**, sorted using a relation on the elements and stored in a dynamic array.

## ADT SortedSet represented on Doubly Linked List on Array

***ADT Sorted Set*** - implemented using a **doubly linked list represented on array**, where elements are ordered based on a relation between the elements.
